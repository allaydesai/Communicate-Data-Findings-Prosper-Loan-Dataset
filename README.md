### OVERVIEW

Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process. Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, where we understand the patterns and relationships present in your data. Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques in the data analysis process. In the first part, Python visualization libraries are used to systematically explore Prosper Loan dataset, starting from plots of single variables (Univariate) and building up to plots of multiple variables (bivariate and multivariate). In the second part, a short presentation was created which illustrates interesting properties, trends, and relationships that were discovered in the dataset. The exploratory visualizations from the first part were transformed into polished, explanatory visualizations.

### DEPENDENCIES

- Python
